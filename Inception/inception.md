Writers: Ricardo Chairez, Ian Dennis, Kelene Moore, Bailey Rosato, Nasya Valenzuela, Nicole Sylvester

## 1. Introduction
For those who are curious, want a hobby, or interested in beginning a career, CodeHub is a web application designed to provide a fundamental programming education without a rigorous schedule or class fees. Users learn in a multitude of ways. They can choose to take on real, open ended, coding projects to test their knowledge. Or they can follow along with guided exercises to learn basic concepts. Along the way, users will also be able to compare their learning to others with achievements and rankings. Users who already know a language will also be able to learn coding by drawing parallels from what they already know.

Future work may include integration into school districts, focusing on elementary and junior high schools, where there is less accessibility for a computer science education. Being able to add a teacher persona to the application that allows them to monitor student’s progress and assist them, as necessary. Another future goal is to include large scale programming projects that will require users to carefully plan their work, and even work in teams.
